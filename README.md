### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I make sure my code works by writing unit tests with JUnit—helps catch bugs early and keeps things stable as I make changes. For security, I stick to basics like input validation and error handling to avoid vulnerabilities. Plus, I review my code regularly to spot any weak spots and make sure it’s as secure as possible.
### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I start by digging into the requirements and putting myself in the user’s shoes. I break down what they need into tasks and tackle each one by one. Testing along the way keeps everything on track and ensures that I’m meeting the user’s expectations.
### How do I approach designing software?

I like to plan out the structure before jumping in, using simple diagrams or pseudocode. I stick to object-oriented principles to keep things organized and modular. This way, my code is easier to manage and adapt if I need to add or change features later on.
